One of the things that hinder people from founding a good company is thing that you have to make
something very epic to have a good start for that product. But from my experience that's actually
wrong. That is why I choose for my next project to do something that don't scale.

## TL;DR

So I am building a tool for developers and I am building it in way that does not scale. Saying that is does not scale means that I
don't complicate the process of making it I just build something
that comes in my mind and test it, deploy and iterate until I come to product marketfit

### Introduction

10 days ago I started making a project called Kepto so this a series where I take
you into the business and development process of Kepto. So What is this project exactly. Imagine a place where all developers are able to see other developers who are in the same circle those who are using the same languages,
those who live near you and join virtual conference, share knowledge and news. Just to be clear this is not a LinkedIn clone where you are able to connect to just look for jobs.
**To say a few Kepto is aimed to designing a connected developer community network just for communication and sharing knowledge**

## Dev

So let's get to the development side of project let's be real who cares about equity that and equity that!. So for the development of the project I am using a the **HypeBeast Stack**
where I am using Node.js, Typescript, React(Nextjs) and GraphQL.

So Why choose this like you know that Node.js is like not meant to be used on the server like it's **slow**, I know that too. Although Node.js is slow it allows fast development
and as an early version of the product I don't care about that what I need is to move fast as soon as and
have an MVP very fast.

And also I am usig drizzle orm by the way and for the database I am using PostgreSQL and
no SQL database I have other than PSQL because it's good.

  Also developing it in a turborepo monorepo is turning out to be very fun.... I
  mean it's easy to just share code and it just have fast start time

## Open source

Last thing to say is that the project is open source meaning you can just go ahead and contribute. But know that this project is not yet ready so the documentation is also not available yet so It might be hard to dive into
the codebase.
