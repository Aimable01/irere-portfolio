When learning about algorithms it's always some how complicated but found that if you take your time and read and solve some problems
you eventually find yourself at the top the game. Now I am not talking about solving those problems that your teachers give you I am talking about the real
world problems that you might encounter during interview or job. So in this serie I will take through the journey of exploring algorithms and a few data structures
in the most understandable way as much as possible, But let's not ignore that some parts might not be understandable at the first time learning them
but as you progress and solve more problems you will understand them much better.

### The language of choice

A language! My weapon to conquer all of those algorithms in no time is non other than `RUST`. So I choose Rust
because I mean who doesn't love Rust and also for the past four months I have been learning Rust and what's the best
way to know more about the language than exploring algorithms in that Rust. I mean if you use a certain language it will expose you to more
techniques used in the language and think that will be helpful for the next big project that I plan to work on using Rust and backend for that project

<Callout emoji={"🧐"}>
  Rust if you don't know is a general purpose hight performance programming
  language that uses the concepts of borrowing and ownership to prevent memory
  management issues with using a garbage collector but instead using those
  concepts. Thus achieving performance similar to that of ``C`` or ``C++``.
