Rust is a systems programming langauge that has gained significant popularity among developers thanks to its emphasis on safety, performance and productivity.
I have been learning Rust since August this year and these are my opionions about rust in general and why I think that rust will be in my future tech stack

  Rust has been said to be named after a particulary robust type of fungi that
  is 'over engineered for survival' according to its creator Graydon Hoare

### What is Rust commonly used for?

Thanks to its direct access to computer hardware and memory, Rust is suited for
**Embedded Systems** and **bare-metal development**. And since it's general purpose it can be used for a variety of applications

Let's see the mojor uses cases of Rust:

- **Building performance-critical backend systems**: Performance-critical backend systems are software components or services that handle tasks that require high-speed processing, low-latency responses, and efficient resource utilizationâ€”and Rustâ€™s performance, thread safety, and error handling make it an excellent choice
  for developing these types of systems
- **Developing operating systems**: unsurprisingly, itâ€™s often used to build operating systems, kernels, device drivers, or other low-level components where control over memory and performance is crucial
- **Web development**: Rust is increasingly being used for web developmentâ€”especially on the server side. The async programming model and performance characteristics of Rust make it fitting for building high-performance web servers, APIs, and backend services.
