summary: One of the major advantages  of javascript is said to be that it is a protype based language. But what does it mean that javascript is protype based language, and why i that an advantage

**_Prototypal inheritence_** is a form of object-oriented **_code reuse_**. Javascript is one of only
[mainstream] object-oriented language that use prototypal inheritence. Almost all other object-oriented
languages are classical.

In **_classical inheritance_**, the programmer writes a class, which defines an object.
Multiple objects can be instantiated from the same class, so you have code in one place which
describes several objects in your program. Classes can then be organized into a hierarchy,
furthering code reuse. More general code is stored in a higher-level class, from which lower level
classes inherit. This means that an object is sharing code with other objects of the same class,
as well as with its parent classes.

In the **_prototypal inheritance_** form, objects inherit directly from other objects.
All of the business about classes goes away. If you want an object, you just write an object.
But code reuse is still a valuable thing, so objects are allowed to be linked together in a hierarchy.
In javascript, every object has a secret link to the object which created it, forming a chain.
When an object is asked for a property that it does not have, its parent object will be asked...
continually up the chain until the property is found or until the root object is reached

Each function in JavaScript (which are objects themselves) actually has a member called "prototype",
which is responsible for providing values when an object is asked for them. Having this member allows
the constructor mechanism (by which objects are constructed from functions) to work. Adding a property
to the prototype of a function object will make it available to the constructed object, as well as to all
of the objects which inherit from it.

## Advantages

There may not be a hard and fast rule as to why prototypal inheritance is an advantageous form of code-reuse.
Code reuse itself is advantageous, and prototypal inheritance is a sensible way of going about it.
You might argue that prototypal inheritance is a fairly simple model of code reuse, and that code can
be heavily reused in direct ways.
But classical languages are certainly able to accomplish this as well.
