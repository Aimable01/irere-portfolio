Choose a problem you want to solve.
Let the problem drive the introduction of new concepts and techniques.

It flips the hierarchy you are used to: material you are studying is not relevant because somebody claims
it is, it is relevant because it is **_useful_** yo get closer to a solution.
You learn new techniques **_and_** when it makes sense to reach for them.

The devil is in the details: a problem-based learning path can be delightful, yet it is painfully easy to misjudge
how challenging each step of the journey is going to be.

Problem-based learning works best in an interactive environment: the teacher acts as a facilitator, providing more or
less support based on the behavioural cues and reactions of the participants.
